# Developer Assessment

This repository contains code used in the interview process for developers joining the Microsoft Engineering Practice at ClearPoint.

The application is a simple to-do list that allows a user to create items in a list and mark them as complete.
It is a React-based front end application that uses a Microsoft Web API at the backend to facilitate using and persisting items in this to-do list.
<br/><br/>

The front end functionality requires the following to be added:

1. The ability to surface any errors from the backend API in the UI
2. The ability to mark an item in the to-do list as complete
3. Add unit tests to cover the new functionality using a framework of your choice

<br/>
Remember that *maintainability and clarity* is key in your solution. 
You are welcome to use comments in the code to outline any assumptions you might make and/or outline your thinking at various points.
Once completed please push the completed solution to your own repo and send us the link.
<br/><br/>
We look forward to seeing your submission and have fun!
